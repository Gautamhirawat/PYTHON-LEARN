what i leared in Linked list is 

1. **Singly Linked List:**
   A linear data structure where elements are connected using pointers, each pointing to the next element.

2. **Doubly Linked List:**
   Similar to a singly linked list, but each node contains a pointer to both the next and the previous nodes.

3. **Circular Linked List:**
   A linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop.

4. **Singly Linked List with Tail Pointer:**
   A singly linked list with an additional pointer pointing to the last node for faster appending.

5. **Skip List:**
   A data structure that allows for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations on a sorted sequence.

6. **Self-adjusting List:**
   A linked list where elements recently accessed are moved to the front, optimizing for frequently accessed items.

7. **Unrolled Linked List:**
   A modification of a linked list where each node contains an array of elements to reduce memory overhead.

8. **XOR Linked List:**
   A memory-efficient linked list using XOR operation for linking nodes, combining both next and previous pointers into one.
