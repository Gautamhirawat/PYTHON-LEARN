What i learned from differnet types of stack is 


1. **Min Stack:**
    - A specialized stack that, in addition to the usual push and pop operations, provides a constant-time method to retrieve the minimum element in the stack. It achieves this by maintaining an auxiliary stack to track the minimum values as elements are pushed and popped.

2. **Dynamic Stack:**
   - A stack that dynamically adjusts its size as elements are pushed or popped, preventing overflow or underflow.

3. **Fixed-Size Stack:**
   - A stack with a predetermined size, where pushing elements beyond the capacity results in a stack overflow.

4. **Linked Stack:**
   - A stack implemented using linked nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the stack.

5. **Two Stack:**
   - A structure that maintains two separate stacks within a single array or linked list, each with its own top and capacity.
