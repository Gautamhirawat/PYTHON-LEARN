i am learning about arrays in python what i learned is 


            One-dimensional Array: Linear collection of elements, accessed by a single index.
            Multi-dimensional Array: Array of arrays, creating a table structure with rows and columns.
            Dynamic Array: Resizable array that automatically adjusts its size.
            Jagged Array: Array of variable-length arrays, providing flexibility in structure.
            Sparse Array: Efficiently stores mostly default values, using a map-like structure.
            Boolean Array: Contains elements with true/false values.
            Circular Array: Forms a loop, allowing elements to be accessed in a circular manner.
